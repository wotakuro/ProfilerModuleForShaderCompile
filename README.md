# ProfilerModuleForShaderCompile

[日本語はコチラ](README.ja.md)<br />

## About 
This tool is an extension module of the Profiler that allows ShaderCompile to be listed in the Profiler.<br />
This tool not only lists ShaderCompiles, but also automatically creates ShaderVariantCollection assets from the ShaderCompile information.<br />
<br />
This is a tool that can be used when you want to see the ShaderCompile that occurs on the actual device.
<br />
A sister tool, "UnityShaderVariantLoggerForEditor" is also available.<br />
This one is used when you want to keep track of what ShaderCompile is running in the application just for Editor play.
<br />

## How to use
### How to enabled
![ScreenshotToUnityProfiler](Documentation~/EnableShaderCompileModule.png "How to enable")<br />

### 使い方

![ScreenshotToUnityProfiler](Documentation~/Screenshot.png "screenshote")<br />

#### 1.Target ShaderVariant Collection
If you specify a ShaderVariantCollection asset here, the ShaderVariant will be added on its own based on the Profiler's information.<br />
Unchecking the "Enabled" checkbox will turn off the auto creation feature.


#### 2.Advanced 
You can disable log file creation here.<br />
Logs are automatically written to the Library/profilermodule.shadercompile/logs folder

#### 3.Counter Data
The number of ShaderCompiles performed in that frame is displayed<br />
However, the ShaderCompile counter is counted 1 frame delayed. <br />
Therefore, the information one frame ahead is output as an Actual.< br/ >
Current frame data is also shown for reference.<br />
#### 4.ShaderCompileInformation

All ShaderCompiles found from the Profiler are listed and brought out.<br />
If ShowOnlyCurrentFrame is checked, only information on the current frame will be shown.<br />
<br />
Also, "Export to csv" allows you to export the ShaderCompile information for all frames in the Profiler to a CSV file.
